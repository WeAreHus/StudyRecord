Change History
==============

3.11.0 (2014-05-22)
=====================

No changes from ZODB3 3.11.0a3:  this release just makes the meta-package
version of ZODB3 installable by default under buldout 2.x.

3.11.0a3 (2013-03-02)
=====================

Made the setup.py file Python 3 compatible. Actual Python 3 compatibility
depends on the porting status of the BTrees, persistent, ZEO and ZODB
projects.

3.11.0a2 (2012-12-02)
=====================

Fixed: The ZODB3 "test" extra was inadvertently removed.

       Note that the text extra exists solely to allow other packages
       to use ``ZODB [test]`` in their test dependencies.

3.11.0a1 (2012-12-01)
=====================

ZODB3 depends on:

- persistent 4.0
- BTrees 4.0
- ZODB 4.0
- ZEO 4.0
